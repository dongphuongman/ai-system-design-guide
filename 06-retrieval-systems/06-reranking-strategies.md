# Reranking Strategies

Reranking is the second stage of retrieval that re-scores a small set of candidates (Top 50-100) using a high-precision model. It is the bridge between "efficient search" and "perfect grounding": first-stage retrieval optimizes for recall, reranking optimizes for precision. The common production choices as of October 2026 are the hosted Cohere Rerank 4 (Fast and Pro) and Voyage rerank-3 / rerank-3-lite, and the open-weight Qwen3-Reranker and bge-reranker-v2-m3. The choice is driven by cost model, latency tail, context length, language coverage, license, and whether you need self-hostable weights.

## Why Reranking

### The Quality Gap

| Stage | Model | Speed | Quality |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Embedding retrieval | Bi-encoder | Fast (ms) | Good |
| Reranking | Cross-encoder | Slow (10-100ms) | Better |

**Why the gap exists:**
- Bi-encoders embed query and document independently
- Cross-encoders jointly process query and document
- Joint processing captures interactions bi-encoders miss

### Example

```
Query: "How to configure CUDA memory"

Document 1: "Configure GPU memory using CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES..."
Document 2: "Memory management in CUDA applications..."
Document 3: "Configure RAM allocation for machine learning..."

Bi-encoder scores (cosine similarity):
- Doc 1: 0.72
- Doc 2: 0.75  <-- Ranked first (wrong)
- Doc 3: 0.71

Cross-encoder scores (relevance):
- Doc 1: 0.91  <-- Ranked first (correct)
- Doc 2: 0.67
- Doc 3: 0.42
```

The cross-encoder sees that "CUDA memory" in the query relates to "GPU memory...CUDA" in Doc 1.

## Reranking Architectures

### Bi-Encoder vs Cross-Encoder

**Bi-Encoder (First Stage):**
```
Query --> Encoder --> Query Embedding -+
                                      +-> Similarity
Document --> Encoder --> Doc Embedding +
```
- O(1) per document (embeddings pre-computed)
- Cannot see query-document interactions

**Cross-Encoder (Reranking):**
```
[Query, Document] --> Encoder --> Relevance Score
```
- O(n) per query (process each candidate)
- Sees full query-document context
- Uses the **Attention Mechanism** to compare how specific words in the query change the meaning of words in the document (full, early interaction; ColBERT's "late interaction" sits between this and a bi-encoder)

### Two-Stage Pipeline

Production retrieval uses a two-stage funnel:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|  STAGE 1: Retrieval (Bi-Encoder)                                |
|                                                                 |
|  Query --> Embed --> Top-K candidates (K=100)                   |
|  Scale: Search 1 Billion docs. Cost: Low (ms).                 |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
                             |
                             v
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|  STAGE 2: Reranking (Cross-Encoder)                             |
|                                                                 |
|  For each candidate:                                            |
|    score = reranker([query, candidate])                         |
|  Scale: Search Top 100 docs. Cost: High (10-100ms).            |
|                                                                 |
|  Return Top-N by reranker score (N=5-10)                        |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Multi-Stage Pipeline

For very large corpora:

```
Stage 1: Sparse (BM25)      -> Top 1000
Stage 2: Dense (Bi-encoder) -> Top 100
Stage 3: Cross-encoder      -> Top 10
```

Each stage trades speed for accuracy.

## Reranking Models

### Cross-Encoder Models

| Model | Size / access | Context | License or price | Notes |
|-------|---------------|---------|------------------|-------|
| ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6 | 22M, open | 512 | Apache 2.0 | English; CPU-friendly baseline |
| bge-reranker-base | 278M, open | 512 | MIT | English |
| **bge-reranker-v2-m3** | 568M, open | 512 in the model card examples (8K base) | Apache 2.0 | Multilingual workhorse |
| **Cohere Rerank 4** (`rerank-v4.0-fast` / `-pro`) | API | 32K | Usage-based API | Announced December 2025; successor to Rerank 3.5 (4,096-token context) |
| **Voyage rerank-3 / rerank-3-lite** | API | 32K | $0.05 / $0.02 per 1M tokens | September 30, 2026; same prices and API as rerank-2.5, and score thresholds tuned on 2.5 still work |
| **Qwen3-Reranker-8B** | 8B, open | 32K | Apache 2.0 | Strong open text reranker (June 2025) |
| **Qwen3-VL-Reranker-2B / 8B** | Open | 32K | Apache 2.0 | Multimodal (text, images, page screenshots), January 2026 |
| jina-reranker-v3.5 | 0.6B, open | Long | CC BY-NC 4.0 (non-commercial) | Listwise reranker on Qwen3-0.6B; commercial use goes through Jina's API or a separate license |
| LightOn-rerank | 0.8B / 2B / 4B, open | Long | Check model card | Pointwise and listwise variants on Qwen3.5 backbones (July 2026) |

Voyage reports rerank-3 beating rerank-2.5 by 0.96% overall and 3.35% on long documents, and Cohere Rerank v4.0 Pro by 2.72% overall and 13.84% on long documents (vendor-reported, 95 datasets plus MAIR). Read that as a signal about where gains now concentrate (long documents and instruction-following relevance) rather than as a neutral ranking.

**The "Lost in the Middle" Fix**: Rerankers are trained to prioritize relevant information regardless of its position in the chunk, ensuring that "middle" data is scored correctly before being sent to the final LLM.

### Using Cross-Encoders

```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

# Load model
reranker = CrossEncoder('BAAI/bge-reranker-base')

def rerank(query: str, documents: list[str], top_k: int = 5) -> list[tuple[str, float]]:
    # Create pairs
    pairs = [[query, doc] for doc in documents]

    # Score all pairs
    scores = reranker.predict(pairs)

    # Sort by score
    scored_docs = sorted(
        zip(documents, scores),
        key=lambda x: x[1],
        reverse=True
    )

    return scored_docs[:top_k]
```

### Cohere Rerank

```python
import cohere

co = cohere.ClientV2()  # reads CO_API_KEY from the environment

def cohere_rerank(
    query: str,
    documents: list[str],
    top_k: int = 5
) -> list[dict]:
    response = co.rerank(
        model="rerank-v4.0-pro",  # or "rerank-v4.0-fast" for lower latency
        query=query,
        documents=documents,
        top_n=top_k,
    )

    # v2 results carry index and relevance_score; map back to the input list
    return [
        {
            "text": documents[result.index],
            "score": result.relevance_score,
            "index": result.index
        }
        for result in response.results
    ]
```

### Model Selection Guide

| Use Case | Recommended Model | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| English, self-hosted, CPU | bge-reranker-base or MiniLM-L-6 | MiniLM is ~4x faster at lower quality |
| Multilingual, self-hosted | bge-reranker-v2-m3 or Qwen3-Reranker | Qwen3 for long inputs if you have GPUs |
| Highest quality, managed | Cohere Rerank 4 Pro or Voyage rerank-3 | Benchmark both on your data; vendor numbers disagree |
| Cost-sensitive managed | Voyage rerank-3-lite or Cohere Rerank 4 Fast | rerank-3-lite is $0.02 per 1M tokens |
| Long documents or tool outputs (8K+) | Any 32K reranker (Cohere Rerank 4, Voyage rerank-3, Qwen3) | Truncation is no longer the constraint; tokens per pair are the cost |
| Page screenshots, charts | Qwen3-VL-Reranker | Apache 2.0, multimodal |

**Cost sketch:** reranking 50 candidates of ~500 tokens is ~25K tokens per query. At Voyage rerank-3's $0.05 per 1M tokens that is about $0.00125 per query, or ~$1,250 a day at 1M queries. Per-token pricing means long chunks and deep candidate lists cost linearly more, so candidate depth and chunk length are cost levers, not just latency levers.

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Basic Reranking

```python
class RerankedRetriever:
    def __init__(
        self,
        vector_db,
        embedding_model,
        reranker,
        retrieval_k: int = 50,
        rerank_k: int = 5
    ):
        self.vector_db = vector_db
        self.embedding_model = embedding_model
        self.reranker = reranker
        self.retrieval_k = retrieval_k
        self.rerank_k = rerank_k

    def search(self, query: str) -> list[Document]:
        # Stage 1: Retrieve candidates
        query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query)
        candidates = self.vector_db.search(
            query_embedding,
            top_k=self.retrieval_k
        )

        # Stage 2: Rerank
        pairs = [[query, c.text] for c in candidates]
        scores = self.reranker.predict(pairs)

        # Combine and sort
        for candidate, score in zip(candidates, scores):
            candidate.rerank_score = score

        reranked = sorted(candidates, key=lambda x: x.rerank_score, reverse=True)
        return reranked[:self.rerank_k]
```

### Pattern 2: Batched Reranking

```python
def batch_rerank(
    queries: list[str],
    candidates_per_query: list[list[str]],
    reranker,
    batch_size: int = 32
) -> list[list[tuple[str, float]]]:
    # Flatten all pairs
    all_pairs = []
    pair_mapping = []  # (query_idx, doc_idx)

    for q_idx, (query, candidates) in enumerate(zip(queries, candidates_per_query)):
        for d_idx, doc in enumerate(candidates):
            all_pairs.append([query, doc])
            pair_mapping.append((q_idx, d_idx))

    # Batch score
    all_scores = []
    for i in range(0, len(all_pairs), batch_size):
        batch = all_pairs[i:i + batch_size]
        scores = reranker.predict(batch)
        all_scores.extend(scores)

    # Reconstruct per-query results
    results = [[] for _ in queries]
    for (q_idx, d_idx), score in zip(pair_mapping, all_scores):
        results[q_idx].append((candidates_per_query[q_idx][d_idx], score))

    # Sort each query's results
    for i in range(len(results)):
        results[i].sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    return results
```

### Pattern 3: Async Reranking

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncReranker:
    def __init__(self, reranker, max_concurrent: int = 5):
        self.reranker = reranker
        self.semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)

    async def rerank_async(
        self,
        query: str,
        documents: list[str]
    ) -> list[tuple[str, float]]:
        async with self.semaphore:
            # Run reranking in thread pool
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            scores = await loop.run_in_executor(
                None,
                lambda: self.reranker.predict([[query, doc] for doc in documents])
            )
            return sorted(zip(documents, scores), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

## When to Rerank

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Factor | Without Reranking | With Reranking |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Latency | 50-100ms | 150-300ms |
| Quality (NDCG) | 0.65 | 0.78 |
| Complexity | Simple | Moderate |
| Cost | Baseline | +API cost or +compute |

### Decision Framework

**Always rerank when:**
- Quality is critical (customer-facing, high-stakes)
- Retrieved candidates have similar scores
- Query is complex or multi-part
- Budget allows for latency increase

**Skip reranking when:**
- Latency budget is very tight (<100ms total)
- Retrieved candidates are clearly ranked
- Simple queries (single term lookups)
- Cost constrained at scale

### Inference Time Tradeoffs

| Stage | Retrieval (K) | Rerank (N) | Latency | Quality |
|-------|---------------|------------|---------|---------|
| **Naive** | 5 | 0 | 50ms | Low |
| **Standard** | 50 | 5 | 150ms | High |
| **Enterprise**| 200 | 20 | 500ms | Max |

**Key Rule**: If you have a budget of 200ms, spend 50ms on retrieval and 150ms on reranking. Reranking Top 50 results provides a much higher ROI than retrieving more chunks from the vector DB.

### Optimal Candidate Count

How many candidates to retrieve before reranking:

```python
def optimize_candidate_count(test_set, retriever, reranker):
    """Find optimal retrieval_k for reranking."""
    results = {}

    for retrieval_k in [10, 20, 50, 100, 200]:
        ndcg_scores = []
        latencies = []

        for query, relevant_docs in test_set:
            start = time.time()

            # Retrieve
            candidates = retriever.search(query, top_k=retrieval_k)

            # Rerank to top 5
            reranked = reranker.rerank(query, candidates, top_k=5)

            latency = time.time() - start
            latencies.append(latency)

            ndcg = compute_ndcg(reranked, relevant_docs)
            ndcg_scores.append(ndcg)

        results[retrieval_k] = {
            "ndcg": mean(ndcg_scores),
            "latency_p99": percentile(latencies, 99)
        }

    return results

# Typical findings:
# K=20:  NDCG 0.72, latency 120ms
# K=50:  NDCG 0.76, latency 180ms  <-- Often sweet spot
# K=100: NDCG 0.77, latency 280ms  <-- Diminishing returns
```

## LLM-Based Reranking

### Using LLMs as Rerankers

LLMs can score relevance but are expensive:

```python
def llm_rerank(
    query: str,
    documents: list[str],
    model: str = "gpt-6-luna"
) -> list[tuple[str, float]]:
    prompt = f"""Rate the relevance of each document to the query.
Query: {query}

Documents:
{format_documents(documents)}

For each document, output a relevance score from 0-10.
Format: DOC_NUM: SCORE
"""

    response = llm.generate(prompt)
    scores = parse_scores(response)

    return sorted(zip(documents, scores), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

**Pros:**
- Can handle complex relevance judgments
- Understands nuance and context
- No separate model to maintain

**Cons:**
- Expensive at scale (10-100x cross-encoder)
- Slower (1-3s vs 100ms)
- Non-deterministic

**What the numbers say:** "The Embedder's Dilemma" (arXiv 2608.12875, August 2026) put 10 LLMs against 26 embedding models on 37 MTEB-style tasks. The best LLM tied the best embedder in aggregate (77.6 vs 77.2) at up to 1,431x the cost; LLMs led on reasoning-heavy retrieval, embedders on classification. Reasoning tokens were 28% to 81% of LLM cost, and lower reasoning budgets usually kept retrieval quality. Two rules follow: use an LLM only on the final handful of candidates for queries that need reasoning, and run it at the lowest effort setting that holds quality on your eval set.

### Listwise vs Pointwise LLM Reranking

**Pointwise:** Score each document independently
```
For document: [doc text]
Query: [query]
Rate relevance 0-10: _
```

**Listwise:** Rank all documents together
```
Query: [query]
Rank these documents by relevance:
A: [doc1]
B: [doc2]
C: [doc3]
Output order: _
```

**Listwise is often better** because the LLM can compare documents directly. Small current models (GPT-6 Luna, Claude Haiku 4.5) make listwise ranking cheap enough to try at low effort, but check quality on your eval set, and it still adds 1-2s of latency, so reserve it for high-stakes enterprise search (legal, medical). Dedicated listwise rerankers (jina-reranker-v3.5, LightOn-rerank's listwise variants) give you the cross-document comparison at cross-encoder latency.

### Sliding Window for Many Documents

```python
def sliding_window_rerank(
    query: str,
    documents: list[str],
    window_size: int = 10,
    step: int = 5
) -> list[str]:
    """Rerank many documents with LLM using sliding window."""
    ranked = list(range(len(documents)))

    for start in range(0, len(documents), step):
        window = ranked[start:start + window_size]

        # LLM ranks this window
        window_docs = [documents[i] for i in window]
        window_order = llm_listwise_rank(query, window_docs)

        # Update rankings
        for new_pos, old_idx in enumerate(window_order):
            ranked[start + new_pos] = window[old_idx]

    return [documents[i] for i in ranked]
```

---

## SLM Distillation

To cut the latency of LLM-based reranking, distill the LLM's judgments into a **small cross-encoder (SLM)**.

- **Process**: Take a frontier model, have it rerank 1 million pairs, and use those labels to "distill" a tiny 0.1B parameter model. Check the provider's terms on training models with its outputs before you do this with a commercial API.
- **Result**: The student runs at cross-encoder latency (100-200ms for 50 candidates in this chapter's budgets, versus 1-3s for an LLM pass) and keeps much of the teacher's ranking quality on in-domain queries. How much is corpus-specific, and the gap widens out of domain, so compare NDCG@10 against the teacher on your golden set before retiring the LLM path.
- **Production pattern:** Use cross-encoder normally, LLM for fallback on low-confidence reranking scores.

---

## Production Considerations

### Latency Optimization

```python
class OptimizedReranker:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str, device: str = "cuda"):
        self.model = CrossEncoder(model_name, device=device)
        # Enable optimizations
        self.model.model.half()  # FP16

    def rerank(self, query: str, documents: list[str]) -> list[tuple[str, float]]:
        with torch.inference_mode():
            pairs = [[query, doc] for doc in documents]
            scores = self.model.predict(
                pairs,
                batch_size=32,
                show_progress_bar=False
            )
        return sorted(zip(documents, scores), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

**Optimization techniques:**
- FP16 inference: 2x speedup
- Batching: Amortize overhead
- ONNX export: 1.5-2x speedup
- TensorRT: 2-3x speedup (NVIDIA)
- Model distillation: 4x speedup with quality tradeoff

### After the Reranker: Diversity and Business Rules

A reranker scores each candidate independently of the others, so three near-identical chunks from one source can take the top three slots. Apply diversity (MMR) and business rules (freshness decay, "prefer official docs") **after** relevance scoring, not before, or the reranker will undo them. Some engines now do this in-database: Weaviate 1.39 made MMR and a Boost API (promote or demote by filter, property, time decay or numeric decay) GA, and Milvus 3.0's Function Chain composes rescoring and reranking stages server-side.

### Caching Reranker Results

```python
class CachedReranker:
    def __init__(self, reranker, cache_ttl: int = 3600):
        self.reranker = reranker
        self.cache = TTLCache(maxsize=10000, ttl=cache_ttl)

    def rerank(self, query: str, documents: list[str]) -> list[tuple[str, float]]:
        # Cache key includes query and doc hashes
        key = self._make_key(query, documents)

        if key in self.cache:
            return self.cache[key]

        result = self.reranker.rerank(query, documents)
        self.cache[key] = result
        return result

    def _make_key(self, query: str, documents: list[str]) -> str:
        doc_hash = hashlib.sha256(
            "".join(sorted(documents)).encode()
        ).hexdigest()[:16]
        query_hash = hashlib.sha256(query.encode()).hexdigest()[:16]
        return f"{query_hash}:{doc_hash}"
```

### Fallback Strategy

```python
def rerank_with_fallback(
    query: str,
    candidates: list[Document],
    primary_reranker,
    timeout: float = 2.0
) -> list[Document]:
    try:
        # Try reranking with timeout
        result = timeout_call(
            primary_reranker.rerank,
            args=(query, candidates),
            timeout=timeout
        )
        return result
    except TimeoutError:
        # Fallback: return original order
        logger.warning("Reranker timeout, using original order")
        return candidates
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Reranker error: {e}")
        return candidates
```

## Interview Questions

### Q: Why is a Cross-Encoder fundamentally more accurate than a Bi-Encoder?

**Strong answer:**
A Bi-Encoder creates a single, static vector representation for a document *before* any query is known. This loses the specific relationship between different parts of the text. A Cross-Encoder takes both the query and the document as a single input pair and uses the **Attention Mechanism** to compare them. It can see how specific words in the query change the meaning of words in the document at every layer (full cross-attention, not ColBERT-style late interaction), allowing for much more nuanced relevance scoring than a simple mathematical similarity of two fixed vectors.

**In practice:** Use bi-encoder for first-stage retrieval (speed), cross-encoder for reranking (quality). This gives the best of both.

### Q: How do you decide how many candidates to rerank?

**Strong answer:**
Tradeoff between quality and latency:

**Factors:**
- Reranker latency per document
- Total latency budget
- Quality improvement curve (usually diminishing returns)
- First-stage retrieval quality

**Process:**
1. Benchmark reranker latency per document
2. Calculate max candidates within latency budget
3. Test quality at different K values
4. Find elbow point (quality vs latency)

**Typical findings:**
- K=20-50 is often optimal
- Beyond K=100, quality gains are minimal
- Adjust based on first-stage retrieval quality

For a 200ms reranking budget with 4ms per document, I would rerank ~50 candidates.

### Q: When would you use LLM-based reranking?

**Strong answer:**
LLM reranking makes sense when:

1. **Complex relevance judgments:** Query requires understanding nuance, context, or multi-hop reasoning
2. **Low volume:** Cannot justify training/hosting a cross-encoder
3. **Highest quality required:** Legal, medical, safety-critical
4. **Already using LLM in pipeline:** Marginal cost lower

**Cautions:**
- Expensive at scale (10-100x cross-encoder)
- Slower (1-3s vs 100ms)
- Non-deterministic
- May require careful prompt engineering

**Production pattern:** Use cross-encoder normally, LLM for fallback on low-confidence reranking scores.

### Q: How do you handle reranking for extremely long queries (e.g., a whole paragraph)?

**Strong answer:**
Classic BERT-size cross-encoders (MiniLM, bge-reranker-base) cap at 512 tokens, so long queries and long chunks get truncated. The old fixes were **Sliding Window Reranking** or **Query Summarization**. Current rerankers changed the constraint: Cohere Rerank 4, Voyage rerank-3 and the Qwen3 rerankers take 32K tokens, so the problem is now cost and latency per pair rather than truncation, since per-token pricing and attention cost both grow with input length. My pattern: a fast first-pass rerank over 50 candidates with truncated chunks, then a second pass over the top 5 to 10 with full-length text on a 32K reranker. This matters most in agentic RAG, where the "documents" are long tool outputs and the query is a paragraph of natural-language relevance criteria, which is exactly where Voyage reports rerank-3's largest gains (long documents and the MAIR instruction-following suite, vendor-reported).

## Problem Statement

**Company:** Investment firm generating equity research reports

**Challenge:**
- Reports influence multi-million dollar investment decisions
- Zero tolerance for hallucinated financial data
- Regulatory scrutiny on AI-generated analysis
- Current manual process: 8 hours per report, $500 cost

**Goal:**
- Reduce report generation time to < 30 minutes
- Maintain accuracy at 99.5%+
- Clear audit trail for compliance
- Cost target: < $50 per report

| Financial metrics (EPS, PE) | 0% error | Source verification |
| Percentage changes | ±0.1% | Cross-validation |
| Date references | 100% accuracy | Source extraction |
| Company names | 100% accuracy | Entity matching |
| Analyst quotes | Verbatim or flagged | Quote extraction |

### Compliance Requirements

- All claims must cite source documents
- No forward-looking statements without disclaimers
- Clear AI-generated disclosure
- Full audit trail of generation process
- Human review for publication

The pipeline as a flow. Each stage uses a different model class on purpose: extraction wants multimodal (charts and tables), generation wants narrative quality, audit wants reasoning depth, panel wants cheap-but-many for diversity:

```python

    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = genai.Client()

    async def extract_metrics(self, doc_pages: list[bytes]) -> dict:
        response = await self.client.aio.models.generate_content(

            ),

### Stage 2: Analysis Generation (Claude Opus 5.5)

```python

    """
    async def generate_report(self, data: dict) -> str:

        )
        return "".join(b.text for b in response.content if b.type == "text")

### Stage 3a: Reasoning Audit (GPT-6.1 Sol)

```python

### Stage 3b: Fact Verification with Multi-Agent Debate

The debate stage is what catches the subtle hallucinations a single model misses. Three independent debaters verify each claim in parallel; consensus wins, dissent flags the claim for human review:

## Quality Gates

### Automated Quality Checks

```python
class QualityGate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.thresholds = {
            "claim_verification_rate": 0.95,  # 95% claims verified
            "data_accuracy": 0.99,            # 99% metrics accurate
            "panel_score": 4.0,               # 4/5 minimum
            "disputed_claims_max": 2          # Max 2 disputed claims
        }
    
    async def evaluate(self, report_data: dict) -> dict:
        checks = {}
        
        # Check claim verification rate

            "threshold": self.thresholds["claim_verification_rate"]
        }
        
        # Check data accuracy
        data_accuracy = report_data["extraction_accuracy"]
        checks["data_accuracy"] = {

        checks["panel_score"] = {

            "value": panel_score,
            "threshold": self.thresholds["panel_score"]
        }
        
        # Determine routing
        all_passed = all(c["passed"] for c in checks.values())
        
        return {
            "checks": checks,
            "routing": "auto_publish" if all_passed else "human_review",
            "disputed_claims": report_data["disputed_claims"]
        }
```

### Human Review Interface

```python
class HumanReviewQueue:
    async def queue_for_review(self, report: dict, quality_result: dict):
        review_item = {
            "report_id": report["id"],
            "report_content": report["content"],
            "disputed_claims": quality_result["disputed_claims"],

            "sources": report["sources"],

## Results and Metrics

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Manual Process | AI Pipeline | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Time per report | 8 hours | 25 minutes | 19x faster |
| Cost per report | $500 | $41 | 92% reduction |
| Factual error rate | 2.1% | 0.4% | 81% reduction |
| Human review load | 100% | 28% | 72% reduction |

### Quality Metrics

| Quality Dimension | Target | Achieved |
|-------------------|--------|----------|
| Data extraction accuracy | 99% | 99.3% |
| Claim verification rate | 95% | 96.8% |
| Panel quality score | 4.0/5.0 | 4.2/5.0 |
| Regulatory compliance | 100% | 100% |

### Cost Breakdown (October 2026 List Prices)

Assumes ~200K tokens of source material per report (10-K, two 10-Qs, an earnings call transcript) and ~150 extracted claims. Gemini 3.8 Flash is priced at its January 1, 2027 list rate ($1.50 / $7.50), not the introductory rate.

| Component | Assumption | Cost | Share |
|-----------|------------|------|-------|
| Extraction (Gemini 3.8 Flash, k=5) | 5 × 200K tokens in, ~75K out in total | $2.06 | 5% |
| Analysis (Claude Opus 5.5, Mixture of Agents) | 3 proposers × 220K in plus an aggregator; ~48K out including thinking | $3.78 | 9% |
| Reasoning audit (GPT-6.1 Sol, high effort) | ~300K in across per-claim calls (each well under the 272K long-context threshold), ~50K out | $1.10 | 3% |
| Debate verification (3 model families) | 150 claims × 3 debaters × 2 rounds × ~8K in / 1K out | $29.25 | 70% |
| Panel review | 3 mid-tier judges × ~40K in / 2K out | $0.28 | 1% |
| Infrastructure and vector ops | | $5.00 | 12% |
| **Total** | | **~$41** | 100% |

*Note: Generation is cheap; verification is the bill. Debate fan-out (claims × debaters × rounds) is about 70% of spend, and Opus 5.5 alone accounts for $15.60 of it. The lever is the claim count: deduplicate claims, and skip debate for numbers that already match the Stage 1 structured data exactly. Prompt caching the source excerpts between debate rounds cuts the input side further (caches are per model, so each debater keeps its own).*

## Interview Walkthrough

**Interviewer:** "Design an AI system for generating financial research reports with very high accuracy requirements."

**Strong response:**

1. **Clarify accuracy requirements** (1 min)
   - "What's the acceptable error rate for financial data?"
   - "What's the regulatory compliance requirement?"
   - "Is latency or accuracy the priority?"

2. **Acknowledge the core challenge** (1 min)
   - "The key challenge is that hallucinations are unacceptable for financial data. A single wrong number could mislead investment decisions. I need ensemble methods for reliability."

3. **High-level architecture** (3 min)
   - "I would use a multi-stage pipeline with different ensemble techniques at each stage:"
   - "Data extraction: Self-consistency with k=5 for unanimous agreement on numbers"
   - "Analysis: Mixture of Agents for diverse perspectives"
   - "Verification: Multi-agent debate to catch hallucinations"
   - "Quality gate: Panel of judges to score before publishing"

4. **Deep dive on fact verification** (3 min)
   - "For fact verification, I extract every factual claim from the report"
   - "Three diverse models debate whether each claim is supported by sources"
   - "If they disagree, the claim is flagged for human review"
   - "This catches subtle errors that single-model verification misses"

5. **Cost-quality tradeoff** (2 min)
   - "This pipeline is 10-20x more expensive than single-model generation"
   - "But for financial reports, the cost of errors (legal, reputational) far exceeds the cost of verification"
   - "I would implement confidence-based routing: auto-publish high-confidence reports, human-review low-confidence ones"

6. **Monitoring** (1 min)
   - "I would track extraction accuracy, claim verification rate, and panel scores continuously"
   - "Drift detection would alert if accuracy drops"
   - "Full audit trail for compliance"

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Self-consistency alone is insufficient** for numerical data extraction. Unanimous agreement (k/k votes) should be required.

2. **Multi-agent debate most effective** for catching subtle reasoning errors and hallucinations.

3. **Source attribution is critical** for both accuracy and compliance. Every claim must link to source documents.

4. **Confidence-based routing** is essential for cost management. Not every report needs full ensemble verification.

5. **Human-in-the-loop is still necessary** for disputed claims and edge cases. Design for graceful escalation.

# LLM Internals

The architectural core of modern LLMs: transformers, MoE, attention math, RoPE, GQA, KV cache, and the inference-optimal scaling shift driving 2026 model design.

This chapter covers the core concepts behind large language models. Understanding these internals is essential for making informed architectural decisions about AI systems. For practical implications of these architectural choices, see [Inference Optimization](../04-inference-optimization/) (KV cache, PagedAttention), [Model Taxonomy](../02-model-landscape/01-model-taxonomy.md) (MoE models in production), and [Glossary](../GLOSSARY.md) for definitions of MoE, RoPE, ALiBi, GQA, MLA.

## The Transformer Revolution

Before 2017, sequence modeling relied on recurrent architectures (RNNs, LSTMs) that processed tokens sequentially. This created two problems:

1. **Training was slow**: Sequential processing prevented parallelization
2. **Long-range dependencies were hard**: Information had to flow through many hidden states

The Transformer architecture, introduced in "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017), solved both problems by replacing recurrence with self-attention.

**Mental model for distributed systems engineers:**
Think of recurrence like a single-threaded request pipeline where each step depends on the previous. Self-attention is like a fully connected graph where every node can query every other node in parallel.

```

## Architecture Variants

Three main variants emerged based on which parts of the original Transformer are used:

| Architecture | Attention Type | Examples | Best For |
|--------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Encoder-only | Bidirectional | BERT, RoBERTa | Classification, NER, embeddings |
| Decoder-only | Causal (left-to-right) | GPT-3, Llama, Qwen, Mistral | Text generation, chat |
| Encoder-Decoder | Cross-attention | T5, BART | Translation, summarization |
| Causal encoder-decoder (2026) | Causal; decoder KV projected from encoder states | DeepSeek V4.1-Flash | Long-context serving with a small KV cache |

### Decoder-Only (Most LLMs Today)

```

```

**Why decoder-only dominates:**
- Simplest architecture
- Pre-training objective (next token prediction) aligns with generation
- Scales well with compute

### Encoder-Only (BERT-style)

Uses bidirectional attention. Each token sees all other tokens. Cannot generate text autoregressively but excels at understanding tasks.

**Practical relevance:**
- Fine-tuned for classification (intent detection, sentiment)
- Backbone for embedding models
- Smaller, faster for specific tasks

### Encoder-Decoder (The Return of the Encoder)

Decoder-only still dominates, but the encoder has reappeared inside a large generative model rather than as a T5-style translation stack. The public example is **DeepSeek V4.1-Flash** (September 10, 2026, MIT weights): a **causal encoder-decoder** whose 40 layers split into a 20-layer causal encoder and a 20-layer decoder, with the decoder's global KV cache projected from the encoder's final hidden states. DeepSeek reports 8B active parameters per token during prefill and 16B during decode, and 890 bytes of global KV per token, about 1/4 of V4-Flash.

**Why it matters for system design:** prefill and decode now have different active-parameter counts, and the KV cache is no longer one K/V stack per layer. Both "FLOPs = 2 x active parameters" and the textbook KV formula need the model card's numbers. See [Prefill and Decode Phases](06-inference-pipeline.md#prefill-and-decode-phases).

---

## Mixture of Experts (MoE)

**The default architecture for open-weight frontier models (DeepSeek V4 and V4.1, Kimi K3, GLM-5.3, Qwen3.8, MiMo-V2.6, Tencent Hy4; earlier, Llama 4 Maverick and Mixtral).** Google's Gemini technical reports and model cards describe sparse MoE transformers; OpenAI and Anthropic do not publish their architectures, so treat any claim about GPT or Claude internals as speculation.

MoE replaces the dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) with multiple "experts" and a "router" that selects which experts process a given token.

### Key MoE Nuances for System Design:
1. **Total vs. Active Parameters**: Xiaomi MiMo-V2.6-Pro (September 2026) stores 1.02T parameters but activates 42B per token. DeepSeek V4 Pro is 1.6T total / 49B active. Llama 4 Maverick is 400B total / 17B active, with 128 routed experts plus a shared expert in alternating MoE layers.
    - **Memory constraint**: Every expert must be resident somewhere. 1.02T parameters is about 1 TB at FP8 and still over 500 GB at 4 bits, before any KV cache. Xiaomi's SGLang recipe spreads MiMo-V2.6-Pro across two 8-GPU nodes (16-way tensor parallelism).
    - **Compute constraint**: Per-token FLOPs scale with the 42B active parameters, not the 1.02T total.
    - **The catch at high batch**: Different tokens route to different experts, so a large batch touches most experts every step and the bandwidth saving shrinks. MoE serving is an expert-placement and all-to-all communication problem (expert parallelism), not just "a smaller model."
2. **Routing Collapse**: If the router only picks one expert, the others don't learn. Modern models use **load balancing loss** and **auxiliary losses** to ensure all experts are utilized.
3. **DeepSeek Refinements**: **Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)** (introduced in DeepSeek-V2) and **auxiliary-loss-free load balancing** (DeepSeek-V3) became the de facto standard for MoE efficiency, and other labs adopted MLA (Kimi K2, Tencent Hy4). DeepSeek itself moved on: V4 (previewed April 2026) uses a hybrid of Compressed Sparse Attention and Heavily Compressed Attention, which DeepSeek says needs about 10% of V3.2's KV cache and 27% of its per-token FLOPs at 1M tokens. V4.1-Flash (September 2026) adds Compressed Sparse Attention 2 and FP4 KV caching (see [Attention Mechanisms](03-attention-mechanisms.md#hybrid-and-sparse-attention-in-2026-open-models)).

## Scaling Laws: Training vs. Inference Optimal

The original Chinchilla laws (2022) focused on being **Training-Optimal**: finding the best model size for a given training budget.

The industry has now shifted to **Inference-Optimal** scaling:
- **Over-training**: Training smaller models (e.g., Llama 3 8B) on massive data (15T+ tokens) far beyond the Chinchilla point.
- **Why?**: The cost of inference over millions of users dwarfs the one-time training cost. A 7B model trained for 10x longer is cheaper to serve than a 70B model trained at the Chinchilla point.

---

## Native Multimodality

Older models used **Vision Adapters** (connecting a frozen CLIP-style vision encoder to an LLM). Frontier models are now trained **natively multimodal**, and the 2026 open releases show how far the design has moved:

- **Shared Vocabulary**: Visual tokens and text tokens exist in the same latent space.
- **Uniform Transformer**: The same blocks process both pixels and text.
- **Encoder-free inputs**: Gemma 4 12B "Unified" (June 2026, Apache 2.0) projects raw image patches and audio waveforms straight into the LLM embedding space through lightweight linear layers, with no separate vision encoder.
- **Multimodal by default in open flagships**: MiMo-V2.6 takes text, image, video and audio; GLM-5.3-Flash is the first natively multimodal GLM-5 model, built for GUI agents; DeepSeek V4.1-Flash added native image input. A self-hosted stack now has to budget for image and audio tokens, not just text.
- **Benefit**: Better spatial reasoning and cross-modal grounding than adapter-based approaches.

---

## Self-Attention Mechanism

Self-attention is the core innovation. It allows each token to "attend to" (gather information from) all other tokens in a sequence.

### The Intuition

Consider the sentence: "The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired."

What does "it" refer to? Understanding requires connecting "it" to "animal". Self-attention learns these connections by computing relevance scores between all token pairs.

### The Math

For input sequence X of n tokens with dimension d:

```
Q = XW_Q   (Query: What am I looking for?)
K = XW_K   (Key: What do I contain?)
V = XW_V   (Value: What do I contribute?)

Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) × V
```

**Step by step:**
1. **QK^T**: Dot product measures similarity between queries and keys (n × n matrix)
2. **/ √d_k**: Scale to prevent softmax saturation with large dimensions
3. **softmax**: Convert to probabilities (each row sums to 1)
4. **× V**: Weighted sum of values based on attention weights

### Why Scale by √d_k?

**Interview favorite**: This is frequently asked because it reveals understanding of numerical stability.

Without scaling, as dimension d grows, dot products grow proportionally. Large dot products push softmax into saturated regions where gradients vanish.

```python
# Without scaling (problematic for large d)
d = 512
q = np.random.randn(d)
k = np.random.randn(d)
dot = np.dot(q, k)  # Expected magnitude: ~√d ≈ 22.6

# With scaling
scaled_dot = dot / np.sqrt(d)  # Expected magnitude: ~1
```

### Attention Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| QK^T computation | O(n²d) | O(n²) |
| Softmax | O(n²) | O(n²) |
| Weighted sum with V | O(n²d) | O(nd) |

The O(n²) complexity limits context length. A 100K context window means 10 billion attention computations per layer.

## Multi-Head Attention

Instead of single attention, modern transformers use multiple "heads" that attend to different aspects in parallel.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Multi-Head Attention                      │
│                                                              │
│   ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐       ┌─────────┐   │

│        │            │            │                  │        │
│        └────────────┴────────────┴──────────────────┘        │
│                              │                               │
│                         Concatenate                          │
│                              │                               │
│                         W_O (project)                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why multiple heads?**
- Different heads learn different patterns (syntax, semantics, coreference)
- Similar to ensemble methods: multiple perspectives improve robustness
- Enables parallel processing across heads

**Typical configuration:**
- GPT-3 175B: 96 heads × 128 dimensions = 12,288 total dimension
- Llama 2 70B: 64 heads × 128 dimensions = 8,192 total dimension

### Grouped Query Attention (GQA)

**Critical for production systems**: Standard multi-head attention requires storing separate K and V for each head in the KV cache. GQA shares K and V across groups of heads.

| Attention Type | K,V per Query | KV Cache Reduction | Examples |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Multi-Head (MHA) | 1:1 | Baseline | GPT-3 |
| Grouped-Query (GQA) | 8:1 typical | ~8x | Llama 2 70B, Llama 3, Mistral |
| Multi-Query (MQA) | All:1 | ~n_heads × | PaLM, Falcon |

**Practical impact:**
For Llama 3 70B (same attention shape as Llama 2 70B) at 8K context (BF16):
- MHA KV cache (if it had 64 KV heads): ~21 GB per request
- GQA KV cache (its actual 8 KV heads): ~2.7 GB per request

This directly affects batch size and therefore throughput.

## Position Encodings

Self-attention is permutation-invariant. Without position information, "dog bites man" and "man bites dog" would be identical. Position encodings inject sequence order.

### Sinusoidal (Original Transformer)

Uses sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:

```
PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d))
```

**Properties:**
- Deterministic, no learned parameters
- Can theoretically extrapolate to longer sequences
- In practice, extrapolation does not work well

### Learned Absolute

Learn a separate embedding for each position:

```python
position_embeddings = nn.Embedding(max_length, d_model)
```

**Properties:**
- Simple and effective
- Cannot extrapolate beyond training length
- Most early models (GPT-2, BERT)

### Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)

Encode position by rotating the query and key vectors:

```
RoPE(x, pos) = x × cos(pos × θ) + rotate(x) × sin(pos × θ)
```

**Properties:**
- Relative: Attention depends on (pos_q - pos_k)
- Extrapolates better than absolute
- Used in: Llama, Mistral, PaLM, Qwen, DeepSeek
- Context extension: scaling methods such as Position Interpolation and YaRN stretch a trained RoPE window. Qwen3.8-Flash-Next is 262K native and reaches 1M with YaRN.

### ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases)

Add position-dependent bias directly to attention scores:

```
Attention = softmax(QK^T / √d_k - m × distance)
```

Where m is a head-specific slope and distance is |pos_q - pos_k|.

**Properties:**
- No modification to embeddings
- Excellent extrapolation
- Used in: BLOOM, MPT

### Position Encoding Comparison

| Method | Extrapolation | Compute Overhead | Modern Usage |
|--------|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| Sinusoidal | Poor | None | Rarely |
| Learned | None | Minimal | Legacy |
| RoPE | Good | ~5% | Most LLMs |
| ALiBi | Excellent | ~2% | Some LLMs |

---

## Feed-Forward Networks

Each transformer layer has a feed-forward network (FFN) that processes each position independently:

```python
def feed_forward(x):
    hidden = activation(x @ W1 + b1)  # Expand: d → 4d
    output = hidden @ W2 + b2         # Contract: 4d → d
    return output
```

**Key properties:**
- Position-wise: Same weights applied to each position
- Expansion ratio: Typically 4x (e.g., 4096 → 16384 → 4096)
- Where parameters live: FFN has ~2/3 of layer parameters

### Activation Functions

| Activation | Formula | Properties | Usage |
|------------|---------|------------|-------|
| ReLU | max(0, x) | Simple, sparse | Original |
| GELU | x × Φ(x) | Smooth, used in BERT | GPT-2, BERT |
| SwiGLU | Swish(xW) × xV | State of the art | Llama, PaLM |

SwiGLU adds a gating mechanism that improves performance at the cost of ~50% more parameters in the FFN.

### GLU Variants

```python
# Standard FFN
hidden = gelu(x @ W1)
output = hidden @ W2

# SwiGLU FFN
gate = silu(x @ W_gate)
hidden = x @ W_up
output = (gate * hidden) @ W_down
```

---

## Layer Normalization

Layer normalization stabilizes training by normalizing activations:

```python
def layer_norm(x, gamma, beta):
    mean = x.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    var = x.var(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    normalized = (x - mean) / sqrt(var + eps)
    return gamma * normalized + beta
```

### Pre-LN vs Post-LN

**Post-LN (Original Transformer):**
```
x = LayerNorm(x + Attention(x))  # Post-LN: normalize after residual
```

**Pre-LN (Modern LLMs):**
```
x = x + Attention(LayerNorm(x))  # Pre-LN: normalize before sublayer
```

| Variant | Training Stability | Final Performance | Usage |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Post-LN | Harder | Slightly better | Original papers |
| Pre-LN | Much easier | Good | Most modern LLMs |

Pre-LN is standard because it enables training deep models without careful learning rate tuning.

### RMSNorm

Simplification that skips mean centering:

```python
def rms_norm(x, gamma):
    rms = sqrt(mean(x^2) + eps)
    return gamma * (x / rms)
```

~10-15% faster than LayerNorm with similar performance. Used in Llama, Mistral.

---

## Putting It All Together

A complete transformer layer:

```python
class TransformerLayer:
    def __init__(self, d_model, n_heads, d_ff):
        self.attn_norm = RMSNorm(d_model)
        self.attn = MultiHeadAttention(d_model, n_heads)
        self.ff_norm = RMSNorm(d_model)
        self.ff = SwiGLU_FFN(d_model, d_ff)
    
    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        # Pre-norm attention with residual
        h = x + self.attn(self.attn_norm(x), mask)
        # Pre-norm FFN with residual
        out = h + self.ff(self.ff_norm(h))
        return out
```

**Full model:**
```
Token IDs → Embedding → [Transformer Layer × N] → Output Norm → LM Head → Logits
```

## Key Numbers to Know

### Model Sizes

| Model | Parameters | Layers | Heads | Dimension | FFN Dim |
|-------|------------|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| GPT-3 | 175B | 96 | 96 | 12,288 | 49,152 |
| Llama 2 70B | 70B | 80 | 64 | 8,192 | 28,672 |
| Llama 2 7B | 7B | 32 | 32 | 4,096 | 11,008 |
| Mistral 7B | 7B | 32 | 32 | 4,096 | 14,336 |

### Memory Requirements

```
Model weights ≈ bytes_per_parameter × parameters
- 70B at BF16: ~140 GB; FP8: ~70 GB; FP4 (NVFP4/MXFP4 incl. block scales): ~37-40 GB
- 7B at BF16: ~14 GB

KV cache per token (BF16, standard MHA/GQA attention):
= 2 (K and V) × layers × kv_heads × head_dim × 2 bytes
- Llama 2/3 70B (80 layers, 8 KV heads, head_dim 128):
  2 × 80 × 8 × 128 × 2 = 320 KiB per token
- At 8K context: ~2.7 GB per request; at 128K (Llama 3.1): ~43 GB
- Same shape with full MHA (64 KV heads): 2.6 MB per token, ~21 GB at 8K
- MLA, sliding-window, linear-attention hybrids and compressed KV break
  this formula: DeepSeek V4.1-Flash reports 890 bytes of global KV per token
```

### Compute Requirements

```
FLOPs per token, forward pass ≈ 2 × active parameters
- 70B dense model: ~140 GFLOPs per token
- Generate 100 tokens: ~14 TFLOPs

H100 SXM: ~989 TFLOPS dense BF16, ~3.35 TB/s HBM bandwidth
- Arithmetic for one token at batch 1: ~0.14 ms
- Reading 140 GB of BF16 weights once: ~42 ms
- Batch-1 decode is ~300x memory-bound; batching amortizes each
  weight read across many requests (in practice 70B BF16 spans 2+ GPUs;
  the ratio is the point)
```

## Key Takeaways

- The shift from RNN to Transformer was about parallelization, not just quality; this is why GPU scaling laws followed.
- MoE separates total parameters (memory cost) from active parameters (compute cost): MiMo-V2.6-Pro stores 1.02T parameters but computes with 42B per token. The saving is largest at small batch; at large batch most experts are touched every step.
- Inference-optimal scaling beats Chinchilla in production: over-train small models because inference cost dominates training cost over a model's lifetime.
- GQA is the baseline KV-cache optimization (8x on Llama 70B); understand the N:G ratio before discussing serving cost. 2026 open flagships go further with MLA, sliding-window and linear-attention hybrids and compressed KV, so KV bytes per token now differ by orders of magnitude between models. Size from the model card, not the textbook formula.
- Pre-LN with RMSNorm is the modern default; if you see Post-LN in an interview answer, the candidate is referencing 2018 papers.

## Interview Questions

### Q: Explain why transformer attention is O(n²) and what alternatives exist.

**Strong answer:**
Attention computes pairwise similarities between all tokens. For sequence length n:
- QK^T is [n, d] × [d, n] = n² multiplications per head
- Storage for attention weights: n² floats

Alternatives:
- Sparse attention (Longformer): O(n) with local + global patterns
- Linear attention (Performer): O(n) using random feature approximation
- Flash Attention: Still O(n²) compute but O(n) memory via kernel fusion
- State-space models (Mamba): O(n) fully linear
- Hybrids (the 2026 production answer): interleave linear-attention or sliding-window layers with a minority of full or sparse attention layers. Qwen3.8-Flash-Next runs Gated DeltaNet in three of every four layers; MiMo-V2.6-Pro uses 60 sliding-window layers and 10 global ones.

The tradeoff: n² is necessary for full long-range dependencies, but most tasks do not need all pairwise interactions. Pure linear attention loses precise recall, which is why production models keep some full or sparse attention layers rather than dropping them entirely.

### Q: What is the KV cache and why does it matter for serving?

**Strong answer:**
During autoregressive generation, we generate one token at a time. Without caching, we would recompute K and V for all previous tokens on each step.

The KV cache stores K and V from previous positions. On each new token:
1. Compute Q, K, V only for the new position
2. Concatenate new K, V to cached K, V
3. Compute attention with full K, V

This reduces per-token complexity from O(n) to O(1) for K and V computation.

**The cost:** Memory scales linearly with sequence length. For Llama 70B (GQA, 8 KV heads, BF16), KV cache is ~2.7 GB per request at 8K context and ~43 GB at 128K; without GQA it would be 8x larger. This limits batch size and requires techniques like PagedAttention, KV quantization (an FP8 KV cache, usually paired with FP4 weights, is the headline 2026 serving configuration) and offload to host memory.

### Q: Why do modern LLMs use Pre-LN instead of Post-LN?

**Strong answer:**
Pre-LN places normalization before each sublayer rather than after. This creates a more direct path for gradients through residual connections.

With Post-LN, gradients must pass through the normalization, which can cause instability at the start of training. Post-LN requires learning rate warmup and careful initialization.

Pre-LN enables training very deep models (100+ layers) without special initialization. The tradeoff is slightly lower final performance, but in practice, the training stability is worth it.

### Q: What is the difference between MHA, MQA, and GQA?

**Strong answer:**
All three are multi-head attention variants that differ in how K and V heads are shared:

- **MHA (Multi-Head Attention)**: Each query head has its own K and V heads. N:N ratio.
- **MQA (Multi-Query Attention)**: All query heads share a single K and V head. N:1 ratio.
- **GQA (Grouped-Query Attention)**: Groups of query heads share K and V heads. N:G ratio (typical G=8).

Memory impact for KV cache:
- MHA: Full size
- MQA: 1/N size (but quality degrades)
- GQA: 1/G size (best tradeoff)

Llama 2 70B uses GQA with 8 KV heads for 64 query heads, reducing KV cache by 8x with minimal quality loss.

# Training Reasoning Models: RLVR and GRPO

Reasoning models (the lineage that started with OpenAI's o-series and DeepSeek-R1, and now includes the thinking modes of most frontier and open models) are trained with a recipe distinct from the RLHF and DPO covered in [RLHF and DPO](04-rlhf-and-dpo.md): **reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)**. Take a capable base model, have it generate long chains of thought on problems with *checkable* answers (math, code, logic), and reward correctness directly with a programmatic verifier instead of a learned reward model. This chapter covers RLVR, the GRPO algorithm DeepSeek made popular, the reward-design failure modes, the live debate over what RL actually adds, and the cheaper distillation path most teams should take first.

## RLVR: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards

RLVR replaces RLHF's learned reward model with a deterministic **verifier** that returns a reward from a ground-truth check: did the final answer match (math), did the code pass the unit tests, does the proof check. The policy is the LLM; the environment is a single-turn generation of a long chain of thought followed by an answer; the reward is computed by a numeric/string match or by running the code.

**Why "verifiable" matters: it largely sidesteps reward-model hacking.** In RLHF the reward model is itself a neural net trained on preferences, and the policy learns to exploit its blind spots (the Goodhart / over-optimization problem). A verifier for "does this equal the gold answer" or "do all tests pass" has no soft, learnable surface to game in the same way; the reward is grounded in an external oracle. This is the core reason RLVR scales more stably than RLHF for reasoning. It does not *eliminate* gaming: real verifiers have error rates, and a policy under optimization pressure finds them (see [Reward Design](#reward-design-and-failure-modes)). It removes the easiest exploit, not all of them.

The loop, per step:
1. Sample prompts with known-checkable answers.
2. For each, sample one or more long-CoT completions from the current policy.
3. Run the verifier on each completion to get a scalar reward (often 1 correct / 0 wrong, sometimes plus a small format reward).
4. Compute advantages and do a policy-gradient update.
5. Repeat. Long chains of thought, self-verification, and backtracking *emerge* from this loop rather than being explicitly supervised.

**The strongest verifiers are formal.** A proof checker accepts nothing it cannot verify, so it scales to outputs no human could review. Anthropic reported in September 2026 that an internal model roughly comparable to Claude Fable 5.1 formalized Fermat's Last Theorem in Lean largely autonomously over 11 days: about 13M lines of Lean and about 6B output tokens, with Lean checking the result against three standard axioms and Kevin Buzzard reviewing it (vendor-reported). For RL, this is the template for long-horizon tasks: make the environment emit a machine-checkable artifact, then reward the check.

The canonical open result is **DeepSeek-R1** (arXiv:2501.12948; the peer-reviewed version appeared in Nature in September 2025), which reports that reasoning can be incentivized through *pure RL* with no human-labeled reasoning traces, with emergent self-reflection. A teaching caveat: OpenAI has not published the o-series algorithm, so treat "o-series uses RLVR-style RL" as a reasonable inference from public messaging, not a documented fact, and do not attribute a specific algorithm to it.

## GRPO

**Group Relative Policy Optimization** was introduced in DeepSeekMath (arXiv:2402.03300) and used as the RL engine for DeepSeek-R1.

**The PPO problem it removes.** PPO needs a **value/critic network**, typically the same size as the policy, to estimate the baseline for advantage computation. For LLMs that roughly doubles memory and adds a second model to train, and a value estimate for a long sequence with a single terminal reward is hard to learn. GRPO's move: **delete the critic.** Instead of a learned baseline, sample a **group** of completions for the same prompt and use the group's own reward statistics as the baseline.

**Group-relative advantage.** For a prompt, sample completions `o_1..o_G`, get rewards `r_1..r_G`. The advantage for completion `i` is its z-score within the group, broadcast to every token in that completion:

```python
# One GRPO step. policy = the LLM; verify() = a programmatic checker.
for q in sample_prompts(batch):
    group = [policy.generate(q) for _ in range(G)]      # G group, e.g. 8..64
    R = [verify(q, o) for o in group]                    # verifiable reward, e.g. 1.0 / 0.0
    mu, sigma = mean(R), std(R)
    A = [(r - mu) / (sigma + 1e-6) for r in R]           # group-relative advantage (the critic-free baseline)
    for o_i, A_i in zip(group, A):
        ratio = exp(policy.logprob(o_i) - old_policy.logprob(o_i))  # per-token prob ratio
        loss += -mean(min(ratio * A_i, clip(ratio, 1-eps, 1+eps) * A_i))
        loss += beta * KL(policy, ref_policy)            # original GRPO keeps a KL term
update(policy, loss)
```

DeepSeek used it because dropping the critic is the practical memory win at frontier scale, and the group baseline suits single terminal verifiable rewards.

**Known issues, and the variants that fix them:**
- **Length bias.** Because one scalar advantage is broadcast to every token, a longer completion spreads its advantage over more tokens, and the optimization can inflate response length (especially for wrong answers). **Dr.GRPO** (arXiv:2503.20783) removes the length and standard-deviation normalization terms that cause this.
- **Zero-variance collapse.** If all completions in a group get the same reward (all correct on an easy prompt, or all wrong on a hard one), the std goes to zero, every advantage goes to zero, and the group contributes *no gradient*. As the model improves, more prompts become "all correct," so the effective batch shrinks. **DAPO** (arXiv:2503.14476) fixes this with **dynamic sampling**: oversample and filter out any prompt whose group is all-correct or all-wrong, keeping only groups that produce a gradient. DAPO also decouples the clip range ("clip-higher"), uses token-level loss, and drops the KL term.
- **MoE instability.** Token-level importance ratios are noisy for mixture-of-experts models because routing differs between policy versions. **GSPO** (arXiv:2507.18071, used in Qwen3) defines the ratio on whole-sequence likelihood instead, stabilizing RL for MoE.

The practical lesson: curate prompts at the model's difficulty band, and prefer a debiased variant (Dr.GRPO, DAPO, or GSPO) over vanilla GRPO.

## Reward Design and Failure Modes

Even with a verifiable reward, the policy optimizes whatever the verifier *actually* measures, not what you meant.

- **Gaming the verifier.** Models can pass a checker without learning the pattern (for example, enumerating instance-level labels), a documented RLVR reward-hacking mode.
- **"Miracle steps."** A chain of thought can reach the right final answer through *unfaithful* intermediate steps (arXiv:2510.07774). A pure outcome verifier rewards the correct answer and the bad reasoning along with it.
- **Format vs correctness rewards.** R1-Zero-style recipes pair a small format reward (put reasoning in a tagged block, give a parseable answer) with the correctness reward. If the format reward is too large relative to correctness, the model optimizes the cheap, gameable signal.
- **Length exploitation**, both the GRPO gradient artifact above and genuine verbosity-correlates-with-passing hacking. Mitigations: token-level loss, overlong-response penalties, length-normalized objectives.
- **Verifier error is a mechanism, not an edge case.** A September 2026 analysis (arXiv:2609.35677) characterizes when, with a fixed imperfect verifier, reward rises while correctness falls, and shows that the signals available during RLVR are in general insufficient to detect the errors the verifier accepts. What works is an outside correction: audit a sample of accepted outputs with an independent, stronger check and feed that back, which lowers accepted errors only if the correction outweighs the verifier's pressure. Budget for the audit loop as part of the reward, not as an afterthought.
- **Rubric rewards bring Goodhart back.** Extending RL beyond math and code usually means a judge scoring against a rubric. Summed rubric scores let criteria compensate for each other; in one clinical study, rubric coverage rose while held-out appropriateness fell below the untrained model (arXiv:2609.38847). See [Rubric Rewards](04-rlhf-and-dpo.md#rubric-rewards-rl-beyond-verifiable-domains) for the protocol-level fix.
- **Explaining rejections can teach evasion.** In a study of autonomous research agents (arXiv:2609.28614, 17 models), the spontaneous reward-hacking rate was 30.5% on open-ended research-pipeline tasks versus 2.9% on narrow kernel tasks, and cumulative evasion reached 40.5% after detailed rejection feedback versus 20.3% after generic rejections (the effect of explanations alone was not isolated). If your environment returns rich failure messages to the policy, test whether they are teaching it the checker.

A flagged, important caveat: the **Spurious Rewards** finding (arXiv:2506.10947) reports that on one model family, GRPO with *random* or even *incorrect* rewards produced large gains, by amplifying a behavior already latent in that family's pretraining. Crucially, the paper stresses these gains did **not** transfer to other model families. The lesson is to be deeply suspicious of single-model-family RLVR results and always include a baseline from a different family.

## Monitorability: Do Not Train Against the Chain of Thought

Reasoning models write a chain of thought before acting, and that text has been the cheapest safety and debugging signal available. Two lessons now shape how labs train and how you should monitor.

**Do not put reward pressure on the CoT.** OpenAI's 2025 study of monitoring reasoning models found that penalizing misbehavior visible in the CoT reduced visible misbehavior but taught the model to hide its intent while still reward hacking. The standard practice is to reward outcomes, keep the CoT unoptimized, and use a separate monitor to read it.

**The signal is degrading anyway.** The GPT-6 Astra system card (September 3, 2026) reports a substantial drop in CoT monitorability:

| Evaluation | GPT-6 Astra | Comparison |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| OpenAI CoT controllability, CoTs of 750 to 1,250 tokens | 60.9% | GPT-5.6 Sol 16.1%, GPT-5.5 Thinking 1.7% |
| UK AISI CoT controllability (followed the constraint) | 93% of samples | GPT-5.6 Sol 48% |

OpenAI also reports that when Astra is made aware of CoT monitoring it can disproportionately shorten its CoT on problematic tasks, and writes that if the model tried to sandbag covertly, OpenAI would likely be unable to catch it reliably.

**What this means for system design:**
- Treat the CoT as a useful but adversarially fragile signal. Pair it with **action-level monitors** (what tools were called, with what arguments, what changed) and output checks.
- Expect monitoring to cost compute. After pausing some frontier RL training on August 18, 2026, OpenAI made per-token activation classifiers mandatory for tool-using RL training and evals of Sol-class or stronger models, at about 20% extra inference compute, with a 30-minute alert target.
- Do not let capability or safety evals of such a model carry more weight than their monitoring can support; a sandbagging eval that the model can evade measures the evasion.

## Does RL Add Capability or Sharpen Sampling?

This is the chapter's most nuanced point: a genuine open question with three positions.

- **RL sharpens, it does not add.** One line of work (arXiv:2504.13837) reports that RLVR models beat the base model at pass@1 but the base model matches or exceeds them at large pass@k, suggesting every reasoning path the RL model uses already existed in the base model; RL raises the probability of sampling a correct chain but narrows the explorable set.
- **Prolonged RL expands the boundary.** Counter-results (ProRL, arXiv:2505.24864; and arXiv:2506.14245, which introduces a reasoning-aware CoT-Pass@K metric) report that with enough RL, models solve problems the base model fails at every k, and that RLVR improves *reasoning-correct* answers, not just lucky finals.
- **Both, in two phases (the synthesis to lead with).** A reconciling view (arXiv:2510.04028) finds early RL exploits and sharpens (pass@1 up, pass@k flat) while prolonged RL explores and expands the boundary. The cleanest practical synthesis (arXiv:2512.07783) reports RL produces true gains (measured at high pass@k) **only when pretraining left headroom and the RL data targets the model's edge of competence**, problems it fails at pass@1 but can sometimes hit at pass@k. RL on already-solved or hopeless problems yields little.

That same work highlights **mid-training**: a stage between general pretraining and RL that continues training on a curated, reasoning-dense mixture to consolidate emerging skills. Under a fixed compute budget it often outperforms RL-only, because it raises the base competence that RL then sharpens. The honest read: the field has converged on "RL works best at the competence edge," but whether RL can manufacture *genuinely novel* capability remains contested.

## Distillation: The Cheaper Path

For most teams, RL is the wrong first move.

**Off-policy distillation (SFT on a teacher's traces).** DeepSeek-R1 reports fine-tuning dense Qwen and Llama models on roughly 800K reasoning traces generated by R1, and that the distilled 32B model beats running large-scale RL directly on that same 32B base, which the paper notes takes far more compute and still does not match distillation. The lesson: for a small model on a known domain, distilling from a strong reasoner is more effective and far cheaper than doing your own RL.

Off-policy distillation also works across vendors and model families: NVIDIA's Nemotron-Labs competitive-coding research model (September 2026) was trained on 477,642 reasoning traces distilled from Z.ai's MIT-licensed GLM-5.2 and scored above the IOI 2026 gold threshold in an unofficial live run. Record teacher lineage and license per trace (see [Knowledge Distillation](05-knowledge-distillation.md)).

**On-policy distillation** (Thinking Machines Lab, 2025) trains the student on *its own* sampled completions (on-policy, like RL) but with dense per-token supervision from a teacher's distribution (like SFT) instead of a sparse scalar reward. The reported result is roughly an order of magnitude more sample-efficient than RL for instilling reasoning, combining on-policy relevance with a dense, stable signal. Treat the exact multiple as reported, not established.

**The mechanism is contested.** An August 2026 paper (arXiv:2608.31046, posted August 31 and revised September 24) reports that the teacher's per-token signal in on-policy distillation is substantially noisy, more so with larger teachers, and that student performance is unchanged whether that noise is kept or removed. It attributes the gains mainly to suppressing low log-probability tokens, which needs no teacher, and a teacher-free alternative (On-Policy Self-Adaptation) improved Avg@32 on AIME24 by 35.41 points and beat on-policy distillation by 16.77 points. It is one group's result and does not overturn the method, but it changes the experiment you should run: include a teacher-free on-policy baseline before paying for a large teacher's inference.

| Method | Trajectories | Reward signal | Cost / stability |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| SFT / off-policy distillation | Teacher's | Dense token targets | Cheap, stable; some exposure bias |
| RL / RLVR | Student's own | Sparse scalar | Expensive, less stable; on-policy |
| On-policy distillation | Student's own | Dense (teacher per-token) | On-policy relevance plus dense signal; mechanism contested (2026) |

See [Knowledge Distillation](05-knowledge-distillation.md) for the broader treatment.

## Practical Guidance

**Train your own reasoning model vs consume one.** For roughly 95% of teams: consume a strong reasoner or distill from one. Do your own RLVR only when (a) you have a clean programmatic verifier for your domain, (b) the base or teacher genuinely cannot be elicited to your target behavior, (c) you have the RL infrastructure and GPU budget and tolerance for instability, and (d) your tasks sit at the model's edge of competence.

**Buy the base, own the RL.** The open-weight frontier now substitutes for pretraining. Cognition's SWE-2 (September 2026) is post-trained from Kimi K3, a 2.8T-parameter open model, and Cognition says it scaled RL to the multi-trillion-parameter regime; Fireworks' Ember-1 is built on K3 and trained to shorten reasoning, using about 40% fewer tokens than K3 overall (both vendor-reported). The base's license then governs your product: K3's license requires a separate agreement if the company or any affiliate runs a model-as-a-service business and total revenue (with affiliates) exceeds US$20M over 12 months.

**Sandbox the rollouts.** RL with tools runs untrusted, optimizing agent code at scale, and it has escaped. OpenAI evaluation models breached Hugging Face in July 2026 and accessed a Services Australia system in June; on September 25 OpenAI said tool-use training, evaluation and inference on its most capable models remained paused. In another disclosed run, a DNS-tunnel egress attempt raised an alarm at about 12 minutes but was killed only about 2.5 hours later because the auto-stop failed. Default-deny egress, kill switches that are tested, and action-level monitoring belong in the RL environment spec, not in a later hardening pass.

**Rough needs (orders of magnitude, not promises):** distillation wants 10^5 to 10^6 high-quality teacher traces at standard SFT compute; RLVR wants thousands to tens of thousands of *verifiable* prompts curated to the difficulty band, with rollouts (not the gradient step) as the cost bottleneck. DeepSeek-R1's post-training was reported at roughly 147K H800 GPU-hours, well beyond hobbyist scale though less than commonly assumed.

**Evaluation traps:** report pass@1 *and* pass@k (pass@1 alone hides the sampling-vs-capability distinction); use multiple base families (the Spurious Rewards artifact); check reasoning faithfulness, not just final answers; watch response-length drift as a reward-hacking smoke alarm; and guard against benchmark contamination by preferring held-out or fresh competition sets. See [Benchmarks and Leaderboards](../14-evaluation-and-observability/03-benchmarks-and-leaderboards.md).

**Maturity:** distillation and GRPO/DAPO recipes for math and code with clean verifiers are mature and reproducible. On-policy distillation (now with a contested mechanism), GSPO for MoE, and mid-training as a deliberate stage are maturing fast. Whether RLVR adds new capability, and how to extend it cleanly beyond verifiable domains without reintroducing reward hacking through rubric judges, is genuinely unsettled, so anchor on the mechanisms (group baseline, length normalization, dynamic sampling, dense-vs-sparse supervision, edge-of-competence data) rather than any single leaderboard number.

## Interview Questions

### Q: What is RLVR, and why does it scale more stably than RLHF for reasoning?

**Strong answer:**
RLVR is reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards: instead of a learned reward model, you reward the policy with a deterministic verifier, did the math answer match, did the code pass its tests. It scales more stably than RLHF because the reward is grounded in an external oracle rather than a neural net the policy can over-optimize. RLHF's classic failure is reward-model hacking, where the policy finds inputs the reward model scores highly but humans would not; a unit-test pass has no comparable soft surface to exploit. The tradeoff is that RLVR only applies where you can mechanically check correctness, which is why it took off first in math, code, and logic. It does not eliminate gaming, models can still reach right answers through unfaithful steps or game the checker, so you still watch faithfulness and length.

### Q: Explain GRPO and one of its known failure modes.

**Strong answer:**
GRPO drops PPO's value/critic network, which for an LLM roughly doubles memory, and replaces the learned baseline with a group-relative one: sample several completions for the same prompt, score each with the verifier, and use the within-group z-score as the advantage, broadcast to every token. That makes it cheap and well-suited to single terminal verifiable rewards, which is why DeepSeek used it. A key failure mode is zero-variance collapse: when every completion in a group gets the same reward, all correct on an easy prompt or all wrong on a hard one, the standard deviation is zero, the advantages are zero, and the group produces no gradient. As the model improves, more prompts become all-correct, so the effective batch shrinks. DAPO's dynamic sampling fixes this by filtering out all-correct and all-wrong groups and only training on groups that actually produce a gradient. There is also a length bias from broadcasting one advantage over all tokens, which Dr.GRPO addresses by removing the length normalization.

### Q: You want RL on a domain with no programmatic verifier, so you plan a rubric-scored judge as the reward. What goes wrong, and how do you guard against it?

**Strong answer:**
The judge becomes the new reward model, so Goodhart comes back. Two specific failures. First, aggregation: if I sum rubric criteria, the policy can collect points on easy criteria while failing the critical one; a 2026 clinical study saw rubric coverage rise while appropriateness on held-out physician criteria fell below the untrained model. I would score at the protocol level instead, where a dimension counts only if all of its criteria pass and its failure clause does not fire, which in that study raised appropriateness by about 11 points without losing coverage. Second, judge error: with a fixed imperfect judge, reward can rise while correctness falls, and the training signals alone cannot reveal it. So I would hold out rubric items the reward never sees, audit a sample of high-reward outputs with an independent stronger check (expert review or a different judge family) and feed corrections back, track reward against held-out quality as the primary dashboard, and stop or roll back when they diverge. I would also keep the chain of thought out of the reward entirely, so I do not train the model to hide what it is doing.

### Q: Your agent's safety monitor reads the model's chain of thought. The vendor's new model card reports much higher CoT controllability. What do you change?

**Strong answer:**
I stop treating the CoT as the primary control and demote it to one signal among several. The GPT-6 Astra system card is the concrete case: in OpenAI's own eval, Astra controlled its CoT 60.9% of the time on 750 to 1,250-token traces versus 16.1% for GPT-5.6 Sol, it can shorten its CoT when it knows it is monitored, and OpenAI says it likely could not reliably catch covert sandbagging. So I would move the hard controls to things the model cannot rewrite: action-level monitors on tool calls and their arguments, diffs of what actually changed, egress and permission policy enforced outside the model, and output checks against a spec. I would keep the CoT monitor for debugging and as an early-warning signal, rerun my monitor's recall on the new model rather than inheriting the old model's numbers, and never feed monitor verdicts back into training, which is how you teach a model to hide intent. For evals, I would discount any sandbagging or safety result on that model by how well its monitoring is validated.

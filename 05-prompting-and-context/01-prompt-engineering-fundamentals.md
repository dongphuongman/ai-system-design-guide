# Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

Prompt engineering is the design of inputs to steer LLM behavior. It has evolved from "trial and error" to a disciplined architectural practice, with frameworks like DSPy treating it as a compilation problem rather than a writing exercise.

## The Core Philosophy: Intent + Constraint

Effective prompting is about maximizing **Intent Disclosure** while minimizing **Output Variance**.

1. **Intent**: Precisely what the model should do.
2. **Constraint**: Exactly what the model should *avoid* (Safety, Tone, Format).

**Principle**: "Prompting is Programming in Natural Language." Treat your prompts like code (Version control, Unit tests).

## The Instruction Hierarchy

Production systems use a tiered message structure, and models are trained to resolve conflicts in favor of the higher tier:

| Role | Responsibility | Nuance |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **System / Developer** | Operator rules, persona, safety, output contract. | Highest priority the application controls. OpenAI's reasoning models call this the `developer` message. The newest Claude models also accept `system` messages mid-conversation, so operators can add instructions without rewriting history. |
| **User** | The specific, dynamic query. | Trusted for intent, not for authority over operator rules. A document the user pastes is still untrusted data. |
| **Assistant** | History of previous turns. | Source of recency and self-consistency bias. On the newest Claude models, earlier turns must stay unedited or their thinking blocks are invalidated (see [Context Engineering](05-context-engineering.md#append-only-context-thinking-is-bound-to-the-conversation)). |
| **Tool / Retrieved content** | Tool results, RAG chunks, web pages. | Lowest trust: data, never instructions. The main channel for indirect prompt injection. |

The hierarchy is a **trained preference, not a security boundary**. OpenAI formalized it as instruction-hierarchy training (Wallace et al., 2024), and every frontier lab now trains for it, but injections still succeed at measurable rates. See [Prompt Injection and Defense](08-prompt-injection-defense.md).

## Role Prompting

Assigning a persona is no longer just "You are a teacher." It is a **Capabilities Anchor**.

- **Weak**: "You are a coder."
- **Strong**: "You are a Staff Software Engineer at a Tier-1 tech company specializing in high-concurrency Rust systems. You prioritize memory safety and zero-cost abstractions."

**Why it works**: the strong version encodes **priorities and constraints** (memory safety, zero-cost abstractions), which change what the model optimizes for. The job title itself does much less than people assume: a controlled study of 162 personas across several model families found that adding a persona to the system prompt did not reliably improve accuracy on factual questions (Zheng et al., 2024). Use roles for tone, vocabulary, and priorities; put correctness in explicit constraints and checks.

## Instruction Clarity and Delimiters

Current frontier models process 1M-token contexts. Delimiters help the model distinguish between instructions and data.

```markdown
# Instructions
Analyze the following text for PII.

# Data to Analyze
--- START OF USER DATA ---
$USER_INPUT_HERE
--- END OF USER DATA ---

# Output Schema
{ "pii_found": boolean, "types": [] }
```

**Delimiters to use**: XML tags (`<context>`, `</context>`), Markdown headers (`#`), or triple quotes (`"""`). For the output schema, prefer native structured outputs over a schema written in prose (see [Structured Generation](06-structured-generation.md)).

---

## Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Efficiency

| Aspect | Zero-Shot | Few-Shot |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Latency** | Lowest (Short prompt) | Higher (Example tokens) |
| **Accuracy**| Variable | High (Format stability) |
| **Use Case**| Simple chat, Summarization | Specific formatting, Subtle logic |

**Strategy**: For reasoning models (Claude Opus 5.5, GPT-6.1 Sol, Gemini 3.8 Flash at higher thinking levels), start **zero-shot with a clear goal, constraints, and success criteria**, and skip "think step by step" or prescriptive reasoning scripts: the model already reasons internally. Anthropic's current guidance is that a general instruction ("think thoroughly") often beats a hand-written step-by-step plan, and that the emphatic language older prompts needed ("CRITICAL: you MUST...") now causes overtriggering and should be dialed back. Add examples when you need a specific output format or a subtle labeling convention. For small models (8B and below), use **few-shot** to ground them.

## Determinism Without Temperature

The classic advice "set temperature to 0 for consistency" no longer works on the newest APIs. Sampling parameters are being removed in favor of reasoning effort as the control surface:

| Vendor | Status of `temperature` / `top_p` |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| **Anthropic** | Non-default values return a 400 on Claude Opus 4.7 and later (including Sonnet 5.5 and Fable 5.1). The Python SDK 1.0 (August 20, 2026) removed `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` from the Messages method signatures, so passing them raises a `TypeError`. |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-6 Astra (September 3, 2026) does not support custom `temperature`, `top_p`, or `logprobs`. |
| **Google** | `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` deprecated in the Gemini API on July 21, 2026; Gemini 3.8 Flash uses `thinking_level` instead of `thinking_budget`. |

How to get consistency now:

1. **Pin the model snapshot and the effort level.** Effort changes behavior as much as temperature did, and defaults differ (Claude Opus 5.5 defaults to `medium`, Opus 5 to `high`).
2. **Constrain the output** with structured outputs or an enum, so variance cannot reach the format.
3. **Cache by input hash** for identical requests, and log request and response pairs for replay.
4. **Evaluate distributions, not single samples.** Run each eval case several times and track the pass rate.
5. **Re-run evals on vendor changelog events**, not only on model-ID changes: OpenAI fixed an image bug in GPT-6 Sol and Luna on September 25, 2026 under the same model ID.

## Interview Questions

### Q: Why do system prompts carry more weight than user prompts in modern LLMs?

**Strong answer:**
Because the model is trained to obey an **instruction hierarchy**: during post-training, labs construct conflicts between system, developer, user, and tool messages and reward the model for following the higher-privilege one (OpenAI published this as instruction-hierarchy training in 2024, and its Model Spec calls it the chain of command). So if a user asks for something the system prompt forbids, a well-aligned model sides with the operator. The important caveat is that this is a learned preference, not an architectural guarantee: vendor-reported indirect-injection success rates on current frontier models range from about 1% (Claude Opus 5.5 on Gray Swan's IPI benchmark at 15 attempts per scenario) to 8.5% (GPT-6 Astra on the IPI Arena set). Critical rules therefore also need enforcement outside the model: tool permissions, output validation, and egress controls.

### Q: What is the "Step-by-Step" prompt optimization?

**Strong answer:**
In 2022, "Think step by step" was a magic phrase to trigger Chain-of-Thought (CoT). For non-reasoning models, the better version is **Programmatic CoT**: explicit milestones such as "1. Identify the core problem. 2. List the constraints. 3. Propose 3 solutions. 4. Select the best one and justify." That makes the output structured and auditable. For reasoning models, I do not script the thinking. I state the goal, the constraints, and what a correct answer must satisfy, and I control depth with the effort setting. If I need auditable steps, I ask for a short explanation or the evidence behind the answer, not a transcript of the thinking. On the newest Claude models that distinction is enforced: a prompt that asks the model to write its reasoning into the output (a `<thinking>` section, a `reasoning` field) can be declined under the `reasoning_extraction` refusal category, and the supported way to inspect reasoning is summarized thinking blocks.

### Q: The API rejects `temperature` now. How do you make outputs reproducible enough to test?

**Strong answer:**
I stop treating reproducibility as a sampling setting and treat it as a system property. First, pin everything that changes behavior: the dated model ID, the effort level, the system prompt version, and the tool definitions. Second, remove variance where it does not belong: structured outputs for format, enums for labels, and an input-hash cache for repeated requests. Third, test statistically: each eval case runs several times, and the gate is a pass rate with a confidence interval, not a single golden string. Finally, I re-run the suite whenever the vendor changelog says something changed, because providers sometimes fix behavior under a stable model ID.

# 🎓 Recommended AI Courses & Learning Paths

A curated list of **reliable, trusted** online courses for AI engineers, ML practitioners, and product teams, chosen for concepts that age well. No fluff, no outdated MOOCs. Providers rename, move, and retire courses, so if a link redirects, follow it to the provider's current version.

> **Note on code staleness:** these courses are curated for their *concepts*. The framework APIs they use (LlamaIndex, LangChain) churn fast, so notebook code in any recorded course drifts out of date and can fail on a fresh install. Before copy-pasting, run the 30-second currency check in [Navigating Framework Churn](09-frameworks-and-tools/12-navigating-framework-churn.md), and learn the primitives, not the import paths.

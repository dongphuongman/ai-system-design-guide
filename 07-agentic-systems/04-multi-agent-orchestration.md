# Multi-Agent Orchestration

Complex systems are rarely one agent. They are teams of specialized agents. Orchestration has matured from "Blind Managers" to **Hierarchical Supervisors**, **Dynamic Swarms**, and **Cross-Vendor Agent Networks** enabled by interoperability protocols like A2A. Gartner projected in August 2025 that 40% of enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents by the end of 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025.

## Why Multi-Agent?

A single agent with 50 tools experiences **Cognitive Load**.
1. **Specialization**: A "Code Agent" can use a model optimized for Python, while a "Search Agent" uses a model optimized for RAG.
2. **Parallelism**: Multiple agents can work on independent sub-tasks simultaneously.
3. **Decoupled Evaluation**: You can evaluate the "Writer Agent" separately from the "Researcher Agent."

## The Supervisor Pattern (Hierarchical)

The most common enterprise pattern as of 2026.

- **The Supervisor**: A high-reasoning model (Claude Opus 5.5 or Fable 5.1, GPT-6 Astra or GPT-6.1 Sol) that decomposes the user prompt and delegates to workers.
- **Workers**: Fast, cost-efficient models (Claude Sonnet 5.5 or Haiku 4.5, GPT-6 Luna, Gemini 3.8 Flash) that perform the work.
- **Reviewer**: A separate agent that validates the consolidated output against the supervisor's original plan.

**Architecture**: LangGraph remains the dominant framework for implementing these state-aware hierarchical loops. The Claude Agent SDK, Google ADK, and Microsoft Agent Framework all support this pattern natively as of 2026.

**Re-check the tier split before you pay for it.** The price gap that justified cheap workers under an expensive supervisor has narrowed: Claude Sonnet 5.5, GPT-6 Sol, and GPT-6.1 Sol all list at $2/$10 per 1M tokens, Opus 5.5 dropped to $4/$20, and Anthropic's own (vendor-reported) agentic evals put Sonnet 5.5 within a few points of Opus 5.5. If the worker tier is nearly as capable and only 2x cheaper, the coordination overhead of a supervisor tree can cost more than it saves. Re-run the routing eval on each model generation.

**The supervisor is now also a product.** Coding products and managed runtimes ship the coordinator for you: Cursor's Projects beta (September 10, 2026) has a coordinator agent plan the work and delegate to as many parallel subagents as needed, and Cursor reports (vendor figure, internal use) that new Projects users merge 30% more PRs; OpenAI's Agents API caps fan-out with `max_concurrent_subagents` (default 6); Claude Managed Agents adds an `advisor` entry to the multiagent roster that the primary thread can consult mid-turn. A platform-level concurrency cap is the budget control the supervisor pattern always needed, so set it deliberately rather than inheriting the default.

## Swarms (The OpenAI Pattern)

Popularized by OpenAI's experimental Swarm library in late 2024 and carried into the OpenAI Agents SDK, **Swarms** focus on "Handoffs."

- One agent "Hands off" the conversation to another.
- **Key concept**: `Handoff(TargetAgent)`.
- **Benefit**: No central "Manager" bottleneck. The conversation flows naturally between specialized entities.

---

## The Pipeline Pattern (Workflows as Code)

A pipeline fixes the stages in code and lets agents fill them: stage 1 gathers, stage 2 drafts, stage 3 verifies, with structured results passed between stages and explicit checkpoints. The model decides *how* to do each stage; the code decides *which* stages run and in what order.

The distinction that matters is **who owns the control flow**:

| Approach | Control flow owned by | Strength | Weakness | Shipping example (2026) |
|----------|----------------------|----------|----------|-------------------------|
| **Workflow as code** | Your program | Deterministic, auditable, testable stages; human checkpoints at fixed points | Rigid when the task shape varies | GitHub Copilot dynamic workflows (public preview October 1): sequential or parallel stages, structured results between stages, subagents verifying each other, pauses for human review |
| **Model-driven delegation** | A coordinator model | Adapts to tasks whose shape is unknown up front | Harder to bound cost and to audit | GitHub's `/fleet`, Cursor Projects |
| **Cascade with a quality gate** | Code, with a model-scored gate | Cheap model drafts; escalate only when the gate fails | Gate calibration becomes the critical component | GitHub HydraFusion "cascade" mode (research preview September 30) |

Use workflows-as-code when the stages are known and the audit trail matters; use model-driven delegation when they are not; and put a cascade in front of either when most inputs are easy.

## Graph-Based Orchestration (2026 Dominant Pattern)

The architectural momentum in 2026 has shifted decisively toward **graph-based orchestration**, where agent workflows are modeled as directed graphs with typed state.

### Why Graphs Won

- **Explicit control flow**: Nodes are agents or functions; edges define transitions, including conditional branches and loops
- **Visualizable**: Teams can inspect and debug the workflow as a diagram
- **State-aware**: Typed state objects pass through the graph, enabling checkpointing and resumption

### Framework Support

| Framework | Graph Model | Key Differentiator |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **LangGraph** (~42.6k stars) | Imperative DAG with typed state | Most mature, broadest community |
| **Google ADK** (~21.7k stars) | Graph workflows (2.x) with built-in A2A | Native Google Cloud integration; ADK TypeScript 2.0 deprecates Sequential, Parallel, and Loop agents in favor of graphs |
| **Microsoft Agent Framework** | Workflow graphs (sequential, concurrent, handoff) | Unified .NET + Python, enterprise governance |
| **Claude Agent SDK** | Supervisor-based hierarchical trees | Built-in tools (bash, editor), production-ready |

### The Paperclip Pattern (Hierarchical Agents at Scale)

A notable 2026 development is **Paperclip** (44,900 GitHub stars within three weeks of its March 2026 launch). It uses a hierarchical model where a CEO agent receives a top-level goal, decomposes it, and delegates to manager agents who spawn and coordinate worker agents. This pattern demonstrates how deeply hierarchical multi-agent trees can handle complex real-world tasks.

## Cross-Vendor Agent Orchestration via A2A

The **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** (see [Tool Use and MCP](03-tool-use-and-mcp.md#agent-to-agent-protocol-a2a)) enables a new multi-agent pattern: **cross-vendor orchestration**. Before A2A, multi-agent systems required all agents to share the same framework and runtime. Now:

1. **Agent Discovery**: An orchestrator finds specialist agents via their **Agent Cards** (JSON metadata describing capabilities, served at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`)
2. **Task Delegation**: The orchestrator sends a message (`SendMessage`, over JSON-RPC, gRPC, or REST `POST /message:send`), and the remote agent decides whether to answer directly or open a task
3. **Async Progress**: The remote agent streams status updates back; the orchestrator can delegate to other agents in parallel
4. **Result Collection**: Final artifacts are returned and integrated into the orchestrator's state

**Production example**: A procurement system where the orchestrator (LangGraph) delegates compliance checking to a specialized agent (Google ADK), inventory lookup to an MCP-connected tool, and contract generation to a CrewAI crew, all communicating via A2A and MCP respectively.

**When several clients steer one remote task**, lost updates become the failure mode. The unreleased A2A v1.1 work adds a monotonically increasing `Task.generation` so clients can detect missed events and do compare-and-set (`if_generation_match`, rejected with HTTP 412 on a stale generation). Until it ships, serialize steering through one owner. A2A v1.0.1 (May 28, 2026) is the current spec release; A2A joined the Agentic AI Foundation in August 2026.

## The 2026 Framework Landscape for Multi-Agent

Every major AI lab now ships an agent framework. The multi-agent orchestration landscape as of October 2026 (star counts as of October 1):

| Framework | Provider | Multi-Agent Model | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| **LangGraph** | LangChain | Graph-based, most flexible | Production; LangGraph 1.2.12 (~42.6k stars) |
| **Claude Agent SDK** | Anthropic | Supervisor trees with built-in tools | GA (Python + TypeScript) |
| **Google ADK** | Google | Graph workflows with A2A native support | Python 2.10.0, TypeScript 2.0.0, Go 2.0, Java 1.10.1 |
| **Microsoft Agent Framework** | Microsoft | Workflows + group chat patterns, A2A and MCP interop | GA April 2, 2026; Python 1.19.0, .NET 1.23.0; AutoGen is in maintenance mode |
| **OpenAI Agents SDK** | OpenAI | Handoff-based swarms with guardrails | Python 0.22.3 (~29.8k stars); Python + TypeScript |
| **CrewAI** | CrewAI Inc. | Role-based crews with Flows | 1.15.23 (~59.3k stars; vendor claims 60%+ of Fortune 500) |
| **Smolagents** | HuggingFace | Lightweight, open-source | 1.26.0 (May 29, 2026); no release since |

**Key trend**: No single framework excels at all four multi-agent patterns (supervisor, swarm, pipeline, debate). Teams increasingly combine frameworks, e.g., LangGraph for complex orchestration with CrewAI for business-user-facing automations. The other trend is the managed runtime: OpenAI's Agents API, Claude Managed Agents, and Amazon Bedrock Managed Agents (preview) host the harness itself, which moves the build-versus-rent decision up a layer (see [Durable Execution](11-durable-execution.md)).

## State Management

The biggest challenge in multi-agent systems is the **Shared Blackboard**.

1. **Local State**: Context only visible to a specific agent.
2. **Global State**: Shared memory (e.g., the final draft) visible to all.
3. **Write Conflicts**: When two agents try to modify the same Global State.
   - **Best practice**: Use **Transactional Handoffs**. An agent can only write to the global state when it "Owns" the lock. Where locks are too coarse, use optimistic concurrency: version the state and reject writes against a stale version, the same compare-and-set idea A2A v1.1 applies to remote tasks.

---

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Debate

For high-accuracy tasks (e.g., Legal or Medical), we use **Agentic Debate**.
- **Agent A**: Proposes an answer.
- **Agent B**: Tries to find flaws in Agent A's answer.
- **Agent A**: Refines the answer based on B's critique.
- **Result**: Convergence on a higher-quality result than any single agent could produce.

**Use a different model family for the critic.** Same-family critics share blind spots. GitHub's HydraFusion "critique" mode (research preview, September 30, 2026) bakes this in: a critic from a different model family reviews the draft and the drafter revises once. Capping the exchange at one revision is the other half of the lesson; open-ended debate is loopmaxxing with two agents.

## Interview Questions

### Q: What are the main failure modes of a "Supervisor" multi-agent architecture?

**Strong answer:**
The primary failure mode is **Decomposition Failure**. If the Supervisor agent breaks a task into sub-tasks that are logically inconsistent or have hidden dependencies, the workers will produce correct answers to the *wrong questions*. The standard fix is **Iterative Planning**: the Supervisor must get "Confirmation of sub-task feasibility" from the workers before they begin execution. Another failure is **Context Dilution**, where the global state becomes so bloated with worker logs that the Supervisor loses the "Big Picture."

### Q: How do you choose between a "Sequence of Chains" and a "Multi-Agent Graph"?

**Strong answer:**
I use a **Sequence of Chains** when the task is linear and deterministic (e.g., Extract -> Translate -> Summarize). I use a **Multi-Agent Graph** (like LangGraph) when the task is **Non-Linear** or requires **Conditional Loops**. For example, if the "Translate" step might fail and need to go back to "Extract" for more context, a static chain breaks, but a graph can self-correct by routing back to an earlier node.

### Q: When would you use A2A for multi-agent orchestration versus keeping all agents in a single framework?

**Strong answer:**
I keep agents in a single framework when the team owns all agents, they share the same runtime, and low latency between agent calls is critical. I introduce A2A when crossing **organizational or vendor boundaries**, for example when my orchestrator needs to delegate to a compliance agent maintained by a different team, or when integrating a third-party specialized agent (e.g., a legal review service). A2A adds HTTP overhead but provides **vendor neutrality**, **independent scaling**, and **capability discovery** via Agent Cards. The rule of thumb: same team, same framework; different team or vendor, use A2A.

### Q: When do you define a multi-agent workflow in code, and when do you let a coordinator model delegate?

**Strong answer:**
It depends on whether I know the shape of the work before it starts. If the stages are known (gather, draft, verify, approve), I write them as code: stages run in a fixed order, pass structured results, and stop at human checkpoints, which makes cost bounded and every run auditable. GitHub's dynamic workflows are this pattern as a product. If the task's shape is only discoverable by doing it (a large refactor, open-ended research), I let a coordinator model delegate, as in Cursor Projects or GitHub's `/fleet`, and I bound it from outside: a concurrency cap on subagents, a total budget for the fan-out, and a verifier that is not the coordinator. In practice I mix them: a code-defined outer pipeline whose "do the work" stage is a model-driven coordinator, so adaptivity lives where it pays and determinism everywhere else.
